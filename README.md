# Unnamed Game

A simple game that I started to make with Unreal Engine 4.

This will remain an unfinished project because I switched to Unity since I want to make some 2D games too.

3D model was made by me in Blender (hence my decision to pursue 2D games for the time being...).

It looked very goofy, so I will keep it here:
